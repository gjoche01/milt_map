# milt_map
This is a project I created for my Global History of Colonialism class
at Tufts University. The question was: What does decolonization look like. The U.S.'s military presence in other countries is a contemporary form of colonialism and supports the U.S. global dominance.  

I took data from the Department of Defense's 2015 report, â€œBase Structure Report: Fiscal Year 2015 Baseline" and used a Amcharts library example to create this map. 
The example I heavily based my map off of can be found at: https://www.amcharts.com/demos/map-bubbles/.
